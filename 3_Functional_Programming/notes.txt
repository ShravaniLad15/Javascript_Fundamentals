**What happens when you run JavaScript:**

*Step 1: Read & understand the code*
The browser or runtime reads your JS code and checks syntax.

*Step 2: Start running immediately (interpreted part)*
JavaScript starts executing right away, like an interpreted language.

*Step 3: Gets faster while running (compiled part)*
The engine notices parts of code that run again and again (loops, functions).
Those parts are compiled into machine code on the fly.

This is called Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.

So:
❌ Not fully interpreted
❌ Not fully compiled
✅ Interpreted first, then compiled while running

forEach is used for clean, readable iteration when an action must be applied to every element, whereas for loops are used when control over iteration (break, continue, index) is required.
